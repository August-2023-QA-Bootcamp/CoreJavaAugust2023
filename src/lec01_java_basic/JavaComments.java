slash + shift 8 (*) + Enter ---- Thats how you can create multiple line comments
Multiple line comments can contain a single line too

/*
  Java Comments:
- The Java comments are the statements that are not executed by the compiler and interpreter. 
- The comments can be used to provide information or explanation about the variable, method, 
class or any statement.
- It can also be used to hide program code.
- 2 types --> multiple line comments and single line comment
- This is an example of multiple line comments
 */

// This is a single line comment
//  Single line comment is mostly used in coding
// Used mostly in the beginning as a separate line or at the end of any line of code
// How to create single line comment: for Windows user: we use ctrl + / 
// for Mac user: we use command + / 

public class JavaComments { // This is beginning of class body

	public static void main(String[] args) { // This is main method
		System.out.println("This is all about Java Comments");
		// control/command slash is the shortcut to write single line comment, 
		// and to re-do, control/command slash, then you will go back to no single line comment
