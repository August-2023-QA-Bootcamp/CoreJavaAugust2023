/*
 What is Polymorphism? *****
-- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. Try to understand it from the Test class where the object is calling the same method with different parameters/signature.

What are the different types of Polymorphism and when does that happen? ******
-- a) Static Polymorphism or early binding or method overloading or compile time polymorphism: happens in compile time. 
-- b) Dynamic Polymorphism or late binding or method overriding or run time polymorphism: happens in Run time.

What are the most commonly called these 2 types of Polymorphism?
-- method overloading and method overriding

What is method overloading and when does it happen? *****
-- When different methods exist with the same method name but with different parameters or signature, it is called method overloading. Method Overloading occurs during compile time.

What is method overriding and when does it happen? *******
-- When different methods exist with the same method name with same parameters or signature but with different syntax or logic, it is called method overriding. Method Overriding occurs during run time.

What is the difference between static binding and dynamic binding? ****************
-- Static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime. Overloaded methods are bonded using static binding at compile time while overridden methods are bonded using dynamic binding at runtime.

In the parameterized constructor, we can reorganize the parameters to get different parameterized constructor. Do you think it is possible in method overloading?
-- No

Is the final type method overloaded?
-- Yes

Is the final type method overridden? *****
-- No

Is the static type method overloaded?
-- Yes

Is the static type method overridden? *****
-- No, But static method can be implemented in child class without @Override annotation
