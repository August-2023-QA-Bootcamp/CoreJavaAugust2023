/*
Java Logical Operators: 
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. example below:

&& ---> Logical and operator (Returns true if both statements are true, x < 5 &&  y < 10)
If both condition is true, outcome [go to condition body] is true
If both condition is false, outcome is false
If one condition is true and one false, outcome is false

||    Logical or operator (Returns true if one of the statements is true, x < 5 || y < 4)
If both condition is true, outcome is true
If both condition is false, outcome is false
If one condition is true and one false, outcome is true

!     Logical not operator [Reverse the result, returns false if the result inside is true, (!(x < 5 && y < 10))]
