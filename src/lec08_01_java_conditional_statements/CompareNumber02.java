/*
Conditional Statement:
Conditional Statements allow the program to behave differently based on condition. 
Below keywords are used
Example: if, else, else if, switch. 
Regarding condition: First condition we have to always use 'if' keyword.
now, if the condition is true, the condition body (inside the curly braces) will be executed. 
if the condition is false, the body will be skipped
Generally we don't use --> 2 if condition (code wise OK), 
Generally the true statement is written at the end.
rather we use 'if' as first condition and 'else' or 'else if' as second condition. 
When we write 'else' keyword, no condition is necessary to write,
Whatever you want to print, it will be printed in else block. 
either it is true or false, correct or incorrect, it doesn't matter
