// Abstract Class contains both abstract and non abstract methods
// Abstract Class names starts with UpperCase like a regular class
// They follow Camel case or Snake case pattern.
// CamelCase or Snake_case feature considered from second word, not from first word
// CamelCase example for an Abstract Class --> ElectricCar
// Snake_case example for an Abstract Class --> Electric_car

	// when method is declared, that method is also called abstract method
	// This is mandatory to put abstract keyword with the abstract method inside Abstract Class
	// This is the norm/rules to write at least one abstract method inside abstract class
