// Indentation: A new Java programmer must be a master in the concept of "indentation" in Java. 
// Indentation is used to make our code readable to other users, easier to edit, 
// display how the curly braces match up and show the logic of the program in an organized fashion. 
// The best way, to put the cursor at the end of last line of code and press Enter
// we learn indentation above, also below -- how to close classes when they are multiple classes opened

// how to close the classes already opened? What kind of options are present?
// Do a Right click -- one of the class from the header and choose from below
// close, close all, close others, close to left, close to right, detach etc
// you choose what ever needed
